# Space_Vector
2D turn bassed strategy game with procedural generation and momentum mechanics

The procedural generation for the astroid fields is complete. Generates a 2D array with 4 possible cell values: Space, small astroid, medium astroid and big astroid. 32x32 cell blocks are generated in such way that the fields look continous and don't have sharp edges where astroids were genreated on the edge of one block but not the edge of the adjacent one.
